# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Distributed Training

For this project, two separate versions of the Unity environment were provided:
- The first version contains a single agent.
- The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.  

The second version is useful for algorithms like [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf), and [D4PG](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZipzbCb) that use multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience.  

### Solving the Environment

The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different. In particular, your agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents). Specifically,
- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) scores.  We then take the average of these 20 scores. 
- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30. 

### Approach

The approach used for completing the projects is Deep deterministic policy gradient. It is a type of actor-critic method where two neural network architectures are used, one works as the actor and the other as the critic. The job of the actor is to predict the optimal policy mu which will be used by the agent to perform the task. The job of the critic is to predict a value which will be used to tune the weights of the actor network. The network used here incorporates various techniques like experience replay and fixed Q-target just like vanilla DQN. This algorithm worked pretty well and I was able to achieve the target average score of +13 over 100 consecutive steps over 20 different agents was obtained in just 4 episodes. It can also be observed that the reward obtained after around 25 episodes is almost always between +35 to +38.

### Network architecture

The actor network architecture was fairly simple with two fully connected layers of size 400 and 300 as mentoned in the paper followed by another linear output layer of output size 2 in this case for every agent as there are two joints. A final tanh activation layer was applied to get a value between -1 and 1. Batch normalisation was used after both the layers to obtain quicker convergence. All the layer weights and biases were initialised as mentioned in the research paper on [DDPG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf)
The critic network architecture was a little more complicated. First a state value output was obtained by activating the state input by passing it through two fully connected convolutional layers, again of size 400 and 300. ReLu activation and batch normalisation was used between the layers. After that another fully connected layer is used to obtain the action value output from the action input which has an output size same as that of the second fully connected layer. The two values are then added after ReLu activation and then a final linear layer is obtained to get a single output value.

    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p2_continuous-control/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.
