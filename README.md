# Deep_reinforcement_learning
This repository includes various projects using different deep reinforcement learning algorithms and concepts performend on various openAI and Unity environments.

### OpenAI_Exercises
This folder contains various python notebooks in which different openAI environments like CartPole, MountainClimbing, Lunar lander etc have been solved using RL algorithms. Check out the notebooks for more details on that.

### Project 1 - Navigation
In this project, an agent was trained using a Deep-Q network to navigate in a square world full of yellow and blue bananas. The agent learnt to avoid the blue bananas and only grab the yellow ones.

### Project 2 - Continuous control
In this project, robotic arms learnt how to align themselves in a particular target position by applying different value of torques to the two joints. The agent was trained using a DDPG model.

### Project 3 - Competition and collaboration
In this project, two agents were trained to play tennis with each other without letting the ball drop. This is an example of a multi-agent problem and hence was tackled using a multi-agent DDPG algorithm.
